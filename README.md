# Detecting Gentrification in the Neighborhoods of New York City
## By Paul Torres

The goal of this project is to build a model that will be able to detect which neighborhoods are undergoing the process of gentrification. 

## Business Case
The demographic makeup of neighborhoods in New York City can change dramatically in the years between the decennial national census'. Over the most recent decades, it has occurred because New York City has rebounded from the disastrous 1970's and areas have become desirable again. This means that what were once under served communities have become hotspots for development and expansion of upscale living. This phenomenon is known as gentrification. Gentrification leads to displacement of whole communities that are under represented in local politics and most at risk for poverty related complications. A model that can identify a neighborhood at risk for gentrification would allow interested groups to reallocate resources to prevent displacement. A method that would be able to do so with the provided data would be helpful to community groups and government agencies to help those at risk for displacement.


## Overview

## Repository Structure
- Image -- contains images created during EDA and those linked in README
- LTDB_data -- contains all of the data cleaning steps and techniques with markdowns explaining reasoning
- EDA -- 
- Clusters -- contains all the code that determine the gentrification level of census tracts while looking at other census tracts with similar 

## Data
The majority of the data came from 

## Preprocessing (Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering)

Standard data cleaning in order to fill in missing values, dispose of observations that were heavily flawed, and remove observations that did not include residential areas but were in fact parks, prisons, or heavily commercial areas.
